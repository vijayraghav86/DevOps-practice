ELB:
=====
1) The purpose of ELB is to distribute the incoming load between multiple EC2 instance.
2) By using ELB we can achieve high availability of application.
3) If one EC2 instance goes down, other EC2 instances will handle the incoming requests.
4) ELB is region level service.
5) ELB always send incoming requests to healthy EC2 instances only.
6) Whenever we create ELB it will generate DNS name.
7) ELB contains port number & security group.
8) Internally ELB is an EC2 instance.
9) ELB send request different AZ's EC2 instance within the region.

ELB Configurations:
=========================
a) ELB Port : Client(Browser) send the request to ELB, ELB forward that request to the EC2 application port.
b) Instance Port: Where your application/webserver is running inside EC2 instance.
ex: Apache2 --- 80
    Tomcat -- 8080
    Weblogic --- 8888
c) ELB SG: ELB also contains SG, In ELB SG we need to allow ELB port inbound request.


Client ----> ELB ----> EC2
                 ----> EC2
                 ----> EC2

Practice ELB:
================
Req:
a) Application is running on 2 Tomcat servers
b) Do the load balancing between both the servers
c) Both the instances in Mumbai Region
   a) One instance is running on ap-south-1a AZ
   b) Other instance is running on ap-south-1b AZ

Step1:
a) Launch 2 Ubuntu EC2 instances in different AZs
b) Login into both the instances and run below commands to install Tomcat8
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install tomcat8
   service tomcat8 status
c) Add "8080" port in EC2 instance SG Inbound rules
d) Create ELB
   i) Goto the EC2 instance dashboard
   ii) Goto the Load Balancer section
   iii) Click on Load Balancers
   iv) Click on "Create Load Balancer"
   v) Click on "Classic Load Balancer" create button.
   vi) Give any name to the Load Balancer.
   vii) Configure "Load Balancer port" and "Instance port"

         In "Load Balancer port" give the value 80
         In "Instance port" give the value 8080

viii) Click on "Next"
ix) Select "Create a new SG"
x) Click on  --> Next --> Next --> Next
xi) Select both EC2 instances
xii) Click on "Next"
xiii) Click on "Review and Create" --> Create
xiv) Copy the DNS Name and paste it into browser.
